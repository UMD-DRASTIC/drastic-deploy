# Overview

Drastic is a data management solution written in Python that allows users to upload, describe, and archive data resources.  Data is managed in a distributed Cassandra database. All changes to data in the repository are followed by a message that describes the change. By responding to messages, the usual repository functions may be extended to include arbitrary workflow. For more information, please see the [project website](https://umd-drastic.github.io/).

# drastic-deploy

The primary way to deploy Drastic, either to a cluster or to local virtual machines, is using the Ansible playbooks in this repository. Most of the how-to guides are also here with the playbooks. This is because the instructions tend to change in tandem with the playbooks themselves. Someone may clone an old or new version and still have accurate instructions.
